## DRTYsnow

This branch is specifically been structured to comply with the Udacity FSND P3


## Synopsis

A tool to monitor the realtime condition of inbound marked runs on ski resorts,
using user generated content. A Waze for skiing.

## Motivation

Snow conditions on ski runs change from hour to hour, and resort management is
rarely motivated to provide accurate and honest ski reports. Skiers and
snowboarders are in the best position to provide unbiased, constantly updated
information on the ever changing conditions, and potential hazards on ski runs.

## Installation

This is a flask app, with a sqlite3 database back end. Installation is currently
handled by Vagrant.

Clone the repo, switch to the Udacity assesment branch with:

  'git checkout Udacity-submission'

change into the generated folder and then:
  'vagrant up'
  'vagrant ssh'

Vagrant will install all dependencies, and init the database. The setup includes
generating some lorem ipsum data to help with troubleshooting and dev.

If you want to reset the database, with test data run this shell script:
  'drtysnow/test_init.sh'

a new db file, without test data, can be generated and installed with:
  'python /vagrant/drtysnow/db/dbsetup.py'
  'mv /vagrant/drtysnow/db/drtysnow.py ../data'

Start the dev server with:
  'python run.py'

## API Reference

A read only API is presented, that returns data in JSON format.

To view details on a specifc resort:
  <domain>:<port>/resort/<URL encoded resort%20name>?format=json

To view details on a specifc run:
  <domain>:<port>/resort/<URL encoded resort%20name>/run/<run id integer>?format=json

To view details of a specifc user:
  <domain>:<port>/profile/<user id integer>?format=json

To view a list of all resorts:
  <domain>:<port>/resorts/?format=json

## Addressing Rubrik Criteria:

This is a fairly large project, thats grown in scope beyond the initial Rubrik
to make things a little easier, here is a key to find relevant sections of code:

API Endpoints:
    All view functions return JSON. Add '?format=json' to any view URL to retrieve JSON.
    JSON is implemented inside the standard web view controllers.

CRUD Read:
    Read Category from DB (runs with sub reviews, or resorts with sub runs in this context).
    db is called drtysnow.db, and is autogenerated at install. Can be reinitialised. Images
    are read from the DB, which points to the local file system.
CRUD Create:
    A registered user can create reviews that are stored in the database.
    A registered admin can create reviews, new resorts, and new Runs. Images can be uploaded when
    creating a resort.
CRUD Update:
  All registered users can edit favourite resort, and admin status on the profile page.
  Admins can modify all fields on resorts and runs, including images.
CRUD Delete:
  Admins can delete everything they create (Runs, Reviews, and Resorts.). CSRF tokens are used for
  data protection.

OAuth:
  Users are created via Google Oauth. A user record is then stored locally, and authed users content (reviews) are associated with the person who made them. Also, there are 3 tiers of users (unknown, user, admin). These three levels all have different abilities on the site.
