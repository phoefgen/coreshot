## DRTYsnow

This project is currently in early development, and does not function at all at
this stage.

## Synopsis

A tool to monitor the realtime condition of inbound marked runs on ski resorts,
using user generated content. A Waze for skiing.

## Motivation

Snow conditions on ski runs change from hour to hour, and resort management is
rarely motivated to provide accurate and honest ski reports. Skiers and
snowboarders are in the best position to provide unbiased, constantly updated
information on the ever changing conditions, and potential hazards on ski runs.

## Installation

This is a flask app, with a postgres back end. Details to follow.

## API Reference

an API will be presented, but does not yet exist.

## Tests

Tests will be created, but do not yet exist.
